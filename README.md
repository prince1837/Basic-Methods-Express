# Basic-Methods-Express
In Basic-Methods-Express I have learnt about Basic get, put, post and Delete methods how to work on server
Here I implemented a basic version of an eLearning API, using express framework of Node JS. The users can manage and create different courses, exercises and also manage submissions, using basic CRUD operations.

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

To install express, run the following command on your terminal in Linux.

    sudo apt-get install npm
    npm install express --save
    npm install nodemon --save
  
To run your code, first open your server port using nodemon serverapi.js in your working directory in terminal. And, then you can apply the basic CRUD operations
